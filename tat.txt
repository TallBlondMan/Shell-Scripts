A Tips and Tricks file I will pipulate with things I learned

1. You can get the loop in Bash:
	mkdir rc{1,2,3,E}.d 
   This will create 4 folders with names
	-rc1.d
	-rc2.d 
	-rc3.d
	-rcE.d
   This can be done recursively:
	$ ls -ld {,usr,usr/local}/{bin,sbin,lib}

2. The '[' is a builtin operator and is responsible for test has to be put with a SPACE 	
	if [ OPERATIO ]

	&& and || are TRUE and FALSE and will run code depending on test result
		$ if [ $X ] && echo "TRUE" || echo "FALSE"
		TRUE - if X has a value
		FALSE if X has not a value
